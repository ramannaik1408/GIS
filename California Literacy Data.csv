1 Estimated population size of persons 16 years and older in households in 2003.,,,,,
2 Those lacking Basic prose literacy skills include those who scored Below Basic in prose and those who could not be tested due to language barriers.,,,,,
3 The estimated percent lacking Basic prose literacy skills has a margin of error as measured by the associated credible interval. There is a 95% chance that the value of the percent lacking Basic prose literacy skills is contained between the lower and upper bound.,,,,,
