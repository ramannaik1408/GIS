"See the Census Bureau website for a description of FIPS codes.

*The 2013 Rural-urban Continuum Codes classify metropolitan counties (codes 1 through 3) by size of the Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), and nonmetropolitan counties (codes 4 through 9) by degree of urbanization and proximity to metro areas. See the Rural-urban continuum codes for definitions of each code.

For 1970 and 1980, the share of adults who are college graduates includes those who completed four or more years of college regardless of degree earned. For 1990 through the most recent estimates, the share includes those who received a bachelor’s or higher degree.

The Census Bureau's American Community Survey estimates are derived from survey data collected over a 5-year period.

Data are for adults 25 years of age and older.
